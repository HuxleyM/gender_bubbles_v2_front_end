## Gender Bubbles V2 ##

DEPLOYED HERE: http://gender-bubbles.surge.sh/

Link to node backend : coming soon

## intro ##

This is one of my all time favourite projects, previously made with a lamp stack ive re made it better, faster and less tempramental in react! This is a living gender identity survey, that only rejects sex female and male (intersex and trans are also allowed as these are minority that transends into gender). 

## challenges ##

The hardest part of this task is in the revisiting. As this is an older project my thought pattern is sometime locked or naturally assumes ways to recreate parts of this app. Taking time to rethink logic in order to make code less dependent then before is really challenging.


## User Stories ## 

A user should be able to submit a gender identity. 

A user should recieve a success notification on submition of their gender identity. 

A submition of sex - other than intersex or trans (these are marginlized communities in which sex tranends into a gender identity) - shall result in an error notification.

There should me a menu, clicking on different menu items should display the relevant corresponding data. 

Submition of an identity should refresh the canvas component. 

Gender identities should be represented as floating circles, whose size is dependent on the percentage of the identity out of all of the submitions. 

clicking on a circle should display idenity and volume of respondents.

clicking on a circle should highlight the circle, making it easier to follow. 









## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
